    <p style="font-weight:bold">On September 29, 2025, United States president Donald Trump announced a new plan in a press conference at the White House alongside Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address the ongoing Gaza war and the broader Middle Eastern crisis. The plan was negotiated with the consultation of many neighboring Arab countries and Muslim countries from around the world and constitutes a new ceasefire and release of all hostages in phase 1. Commonly referred to in news reports as Trump's 20 point plan, it is different from Trump's earlier Gaza Strip proposal, made in February 2025, and contains 20 specific points, not all of which Hamas has agreed to.[2] On September 29, Trump gave Hamas a deadline to accept the proposal by October 5, 2025, or face "all hell."[3]

After Hamas seized Gaza in 2007, repeated clashes with Israel escalated into major conflicts, culminating in Hamas carrying out the October 7 attacks in 2023, which triggered a large-scale Israeli military campaign. Attempts at ceasefires in late 2023 and early 2025 collapsed, and fighting resumed with an Israeli surprise attack in March 2025. The plan calls for an immediate ceasefire, the return of hostages, prisoner exchanges, the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip, the deployment of an international stabilization force, transitional governance by Palestinian technocrats under international supervision, large-scale reconstruction, and a conditional pathway toward acceptance of Palestinian self-determination and recognition of Palestinian statehood.

The plan was met with support from many countries around the world, including France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Spain, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Turkey, Qatar, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom.[4] Before Trump's statement, a senior Hamas official said that Hamas rejected the demilitarization terms that appeared in Trump's plan.[5][6]
